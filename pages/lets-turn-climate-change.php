                    </h3>
                    <p class="py-5 py-lg-0">Due to the events of January 2020 in Australia, where
                        due to climate change, a series of unconventional and uncontrolled Fires
                        were generated, which killed thousands of koalas and left thousands of other
                        orphans the same. Do we have to reach these situations to understand the
                        effects of climate change on humans and the most vulnerable species?
                        <br /><br />
                        Until the human being understands the value that millions of living beings
                        have on this planet, whether we see them physically or not, we will continue
                        to hurt our house that gave us life.

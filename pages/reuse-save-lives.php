                    <p class="py-5 py-lg-0">Did you know that reusing saves your life? In our
                        consumer life, a plastic bottle, new jeans, a new car, and even an orange,
                        becomes waste at the end of its life cycle. Many of these objects are very
                        short-lived and this marks a great problem, generating millions of tons of
                        garbage per year. How to lead a more environmentally conscious life and
                        generate as little waste as possible? If you already have objects that you
                        use in your daily life, you can reuse them in a different and creative way.
                        Reusing belongs to the 4 R'S of recycling. If you reuse, you prevent
                        millions of waste from going to landfills and the sea, thus helping to
                        reduce environmental, maritime pollution and avoiding global warming.</p>

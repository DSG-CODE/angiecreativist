                    <p class="py-5 py-lg-0">When we read a book, our mind travels to another world,
                        history, moment and time. For the concept of the poster, the key to being
                        able to access the book is to be willing to use your imagination, through
                        the alphabet soup game, you decipher the word and you can enter. Imagination
                        is infinite and is the essence of reading, we are presented with letters,
                        words, phrases and sentences that already tell a story, but in our mind we
                        give it another value and give life to those thoughts using our imagination.

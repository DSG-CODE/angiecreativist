                        the destruction of the Amazon? I made this poster after the great fires that
                        occurred at the end of 2019 and they continue to do so in the Amazon since
                        2008. Due to the number of people we are on the planet, it is no longer
                        sustainable to continue eating meat and like agriculture , contributes to
                        climate change, but livestock, by requiring huge spaces for grazing, causes
                        more than 80,000 fires throughout the Amazon Rainforest to date. What if we
                        stop eating what is killing us all?</p>
